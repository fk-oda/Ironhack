**7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.**
The apps retrieved in question 5 probably relate to the most popular apps, i.e., the apps most downloaded.

**8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.**
I retrieved the apps with the best user rating and ordered them by the total rating_count in descending order.
This allows for a more understading view of the quality of the app perceived by the users, since it is harder for an app to have a high 
rating score with a high number of ratings.

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**
The top 10 most rated apps do not have the best user ratings and they have more user ratings. In this sense, due to the fact that more people rated, it is harder to keep a high rating. "Facebook" has almost 3 million user ratings whereas "Head Soccer" has roughly 480 thousands, which means "Facebook" has over 6 times more users than "Head Soccer.

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?**
|Genre|Total|Rating
|-----|-----|------|
|Head Soccer|481564|5
|Plants vs. Zombies|426463|5
|Sniper 3D Assassin: Shoot to Kill Gun Game|386521|5

**11. Do people care about the price of an app?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
In terms of downloads, yes, people do care about the price of an app, as the free app have more ratings.
